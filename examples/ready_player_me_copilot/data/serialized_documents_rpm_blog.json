It felt obvious that people would spend more and more time in 3D virtual worlds over time and would need an avatar that truly represents themself and, eventually, travels across many virtual experiences.\n\nWe started by building 3D scanning hardware and moved on to building custom avatar systems for companies like Tencent, Huawei, HTC, Wargaming and Verizon. In May 2020, we launched Ready Player Me and have rapidly scaled it to 3,000+ customers across the metaverse. We're incredibly proud to work with VRChat, Spatial, Hiber, Pixelynx, Adidas, RTFKT and Dior among many others.\n\nToday, we're excited to announce a $56M Series B funding round led by a16z GAMES FUND ONE and a16z crypto, with participation from Plural, David Baszucki, co-founder of Roblox, Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch and Fractal, Robin Chan, co-founder of Fractal, Henry Ault, co-founder of Eco, Sebastian Knutsson & Riccardo Zacconi, King Games co-founders, Collab Currency, Endeavor, Kevin Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hartbeat Ventures, D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Amelio family, Punk6529, Snowfro, Nordic Ninja, Konvoy and more.\n\nThe metaverse is not a single app. It's a network of millions of virtual worlds people visit to play games, socialize and collaborate. Today, most of those worlds are closed and disconnected walled gardens.\n\nWe believe in the future of an open and connected metaverse that is built by many developers and creators and is not controlled by one company.\n\nFor the open metaverse to emerge, cross-world services and standards that enable virtual worlds to be connected and interoperable must be built. Avatars and identities play a huge role in that. It's essential for anyone to be able to create an avatar they love and take it to any virtual world they want.\n\nReady Player Me exists to break down walls to build a more connected virtual world. We are the avatar interoperability layer for the metaverse.\n\nFor developers\n\nThe actual builders of the metaverse are the game and virtual world developers working hard to create fun and engaging (perhaps even life-changing?) experiences for all of us to participate in.\n\nIt's incredibly difficult to build a game or a virtual world. We aim to make it slightly less painful for developers by removing an important and complex part they have to spend their time on\u00e2\u20ac\u0160\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u0160building an avatar creator. It makes no sense for each game to build its own closed avatar creators.\n\nWe've spent eight years building avatar tech, so they don't have to. Our tools give developers a world-class avatar creator they can integrate in days. This leaves more capacity for the core experience of their games and will result in a better overall experience.\n\nOver time, we will enable developers to take part in the cross-game metaverse economy. Would you rather buy a skin that works in 1 game or 3,000? We believe that building an open marketplace of avatar assets (with the right economics for developers) will increase the market size for everyone involved and will create a much better end-user experience.\n\nSeries B\n\nWe couldn't be more excited to welcome this amazing list of investors to join the journey. The round is co-led by Jon Lai from a16z GAMES FUND ONE and Chris Dixon from a16z crypto.\n\nAlong with a16z, we welcome:\n\nDavid Baszucki, co-founder and CEO of Roblox\n\nJustin Kan, co-founder of Twitch and Fractal\n\nRiccardo Zacconi and Sebastian Knutsson, co-founders of King\n\nErick Calderon (Snowfro), founder of Art Blocks\n\nKevin Hart, HartBeat Ventures\n\nCollab Currency\n\nD'Amelio family\n\nEndeavor\n\nPunk6529\n\nRobin Chan, co-founder of Fractal\n\nHenry Ault, co-founder of Eco\n\nThe funding will help us scale up the team from 51 people today and will give us financial stability for the unpredictable markets ahead. Many developers are relying on us with a key feature of their product.\n\nWith the new funding, we will:\n\nScale the Ready Player Me avatar creator to make it more flexible and performant for the many types of developers we work with.\n\nBuild avatar content creation tools to enable developers, brands and individual artists to create and sell avatar customization assets that work across thousands of virtual worlds.\n\nImprove avatar diversity with body types, granular clothing customization, more accurate face shape prediction, stylization and more.\n\nInclude other avatars on Ready Player Me. We're not aiming to be the only avatar in the metaverse. The goal is to help any avatars to travel across virtual worlds.\n\nIt's been a wild ride thus far, and now the real work starts. We're humbled to have the opportunity to build something so fundamentally important for the metaverse.\n\nThere are many exciting problems to solve at Ready Player Me. Check out our jobs page to join the journey! \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u20ac\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to build!",

We are very excited to launch new advanced user management tools in the form of Account Linking and Guest Accounts to help reduce friction for your users and get them creating avatars even faster. Now, users can seamlessly transition into your app's Avatar Creator without additional logins. Advanced User Management improves the setup experience by creating and linking accounts without user input, streamlining the creation process of avatars.\n\nAccount Linking\n\nUntil now, the Platform managed user sessions in the browser with local storage and cookies. However, this is not the best way to manage sessions throughout devices and platforms. With Account Linking, you can now directly link the Ready Player Me user to your user profiles after they are authorized and request an access token whenever they return to your app or game. Hence, no more double login - no more loss of the sessions, no more loss of avatars and unlocked assets.\n\nLearn how it works in the Guide in the Docs.\n\nGuest Accounts\n\nPlayers need to trust that their \u00ac\u2020assets and avatars stored safely, even if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have a Ready Player Me account. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s why you can now create a guest account for all users. After the initial account creation, you can optionally equip them with a default avatar so that no further step is needed for them to jump into the experience. Combined with Account Linking, you can now link those guest accounts to your user profile and restore their session whenever they return to your app or game.\n\nUsers with a guest account can easily migrate to a full-fledged Ready Player Me account and take their avatars to thousands of other apps and games already integrated with the Platform. All your users need to do is sign-up or login with their Ready Player Me credentials, and their avatars and assets will be automatically transferred.\n\nLearn how to set up Guest Accounts in the Docs\n\nExperience it live in Hiberworld\n\nHiber is the first partner who launched this new flow.

Like their parents before them, the Gingerfolk worked the farmlands, selling their bounties in the bustling port cities to the north or traveling merchant caravans who braved the mountainous trade routes to the south. It was good life\u2026 for most.\n\nGing, who grew up in The Outer Kingdom, dreams of becoming a Sama\u2014 a warrior protecting the lands from the blight and the machinations beyond. Every year, the Sama hold trials throughout The Five Kingdoms, looking for the strongest and most brave to join their ranks, training in the monasteries for a life protecting the realm. Most joined for fame, fortune, and some notoriety.\n\nGing craves adventure, from leaving The Outer Kingdom and exploring far beyond the realm. He may even travel through the blight. He\u2019s not scared of the Rabbots and other Machinations\u2014creatures that Ging's Pa used to scare him with.\n\nOnce just a legend, the Rabbots are rumored to have appeared. The Sama started gathering their forces\u2014as if something bigger was about to happen. Ging\u2019s Pa and Ma can no longer hold him back as he decides to take a trial to become a Sama to protect The Outer Kingdom from the Rabbots.\n\nNew monetization tools for developers\n\nAvatar Collections is a new tool we offer to Ready Player Me developers. We are working on bringing them to more partners soon.

Today, we are expanding the developer toolset with the first set of monetization tools. This opens doors to an avatar economy for thousands of developers in our network.\n\nDevelopers will have two ways to monetize their apps or games:\n\nCreate and upload their own assets using the Asset Manager and then sell them within their apps;\n\nSell interoperable assets created by Ready Player Me and partners, including premium outfits and avatar collections.\n\nBoth are powered by our new Unlock API. It allows developers to create storefronts within their own apps or inside virtual worlds.\n\nNew monetization tools are currently available to selected partners\u2014including Hiber, 9count, and Omlet\u2014who are helping us polish some features before a wider release.

We are enabling developers to create and manage custom outfits within their own apps and games.\n\nThe ability to upload and manage custom content has been, by far, the most requested feature by developers using Ready Player Me. Our avatar platform has an extensive library of hundreds of free avatar customization options, including content from brands like New Balance, Pull&Bear, and Tommy Hilfiger. Starting today, developers can expand the library by introducing new content unique to their experiences.\n\nDeveloper Studio lets developers customize the avatar editor in their applications. With the new Asset Manager, they now also have the ability to upload, validate, publish, and manage custom avatar outfits. The tool doesn't require any coding skills. Anyone with minimum Blender experience can create custom assets for Ready Player Me avatars.\n\nThe Asset Manager in the Developer Studio is just one way to add custom content to your app or game. You can use the `https://api.readyplayer.me/v1/assets` endpoint in our REST API to integrate directly into your existing DevOps toolchains. Here\u2019s a request example:\n\nHow to create custom outfits for Ready Player Me avatars\n\nCustom assets must be based on full-body templates and follow our technical guidelines. Asset Manager automatically validates outfits upon upload, so developers can be confident that their creations will work seamlessly with Ready Player Me avatars. There's also a Ready Player Me Blender plugin that lets you validate assets during the creation process. The final file must be saved in the GLB format and be under 10 MB.\n\nThe easiest way to add custom content to your application is by using the Developer Studio. Once your custom asset is ready, log in to your Studio account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free. In the Studio, navigate to the Asset Management section and click Add new asset or drag-and-drop the asset GLB file. The next page will guide you through the upload process, including naming the asset, specifying the body type, and setting the preview icon.\n\nThe initial open beta release of the Asset Manager focuses on full-body avatar outfits in single apps and games. In future updates, we will expand the capabilities to make assets available across all applications. We will also support modular outfits with individual selections of headwear and outfit tops and bottoms.\n\nIntegrate the Ready Player Me avatar system in your app\n\nAsset Manager is the latest addition to the Ready Player Me Platform and Developer Studio. It covers all of your avatar needs. Sign up for free here.",

Founded in 2021, the studio is backed by some of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia. In the game, players compete against each other in one of two classic game modes: team deathmatch and capture the flag. With each won game, players collect XP and level up, unlocking new weapons and features within the game.\n\nLooking for a new utility for the heroes\n\nMini Royale: Nations players can claim heroes won during the game as digital collectibles. They could then trade and sell the characters on marketplaces like Magic Eden. Similarly to other blockchain-based games, Faraway\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hero avatars were only usable in Mini Royale: Nations. The company looked for a way to increase the utility of their avatars and make them more valuable for their players. That led them to partner with Ready Player Me and introduce industry-first, two-way interoperability.\n\nTwo-way integration between Ready Player Me and Mini Royale: Nations\n\nMini Royale: Nations players can now create or import their existing Ready Player Me avatars into the game. This gives them access to hundreds of unique outfits and seasonal drops provided by Ready Player Me and leading brands\u201a\u00c4\u00eesuch as New Balance, Adidas and Tommy Hilfiger. They can also enjoy interoperability with live applications from 7,000+ developers.\n\nWhat makes this partnership unique is the ability for Mini Royale: Nations players to bring their existing heroes to Ready Player Me and compatible apps and games, achieving Faraway\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s goal of providing utility to their characters beyond their own platform. This is the first time ever that avatars from a game can be used on any avatar platform.\n\nMini Royale: Nations players can connect their Phantom wallets (Solana blockchain) and unlock their heroes as Ready Player Me-compatible avatars in a few clicks. Hero avatars appear in the Wardrobe section of the Ready Player Me Hub, where users can discover all apps and games supporting Ready Player Me. They can choose from 1,000+ live experiences, including other games, social apps, and tools for content creators.\n\nReady Player Me supports multiple ways of unlocking premium content created by brands and individual content providers. Users can claim new outfits and customization options through unique or multi-use redemption codes and links. Recently, Hugo Boss even made it possible to claim a digital version of their caps through an NFC chip.\n\nIntegrating Ready Player Me avatars into Mini Royale: Nations\n\nFaraway used custom web integration to add Ready Player Me avatars to Mini Royale: Nations. The Ready Player Me avatar creator is integrated directly into Mini Royale: Nations\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 avatar selector, meaning players don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to leave the experience to create an avatar. Since their heroes were already based on the glTF 3D assets standard, they had a running prototype on day one.\n\nThanks to the Avatar REST API, they could optimize avatars\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 quality, textures size limits and atlas settings to hit their performance goals. The same API also allowed Faraway to get 2D renders of Ready Player Me avatars and display them in their loadout and across the game\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s interface. It took a month to launch the two-way interoperability between the platforms publicly.\n\nIncreasing value of Mini Royale: Nations\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 heroes\n\nThe partnership comes with many benefits for Faraway, its players, as well as Ready Player Me\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s community. Heroes previously limited to just Mini Royale: Nations can now be used in thousands of apps and games compatible with Ready Player Me. This opens them to social platforms like Spatial, creator tools like Animaze, and other games like HiberWorld. For Faraway, this meant thousands of new experiences for their existing user base without having to put time and resources into developing them on their own.\n\nUPDATE \uf8ff\u00fc\u00e9\u00e2Mini Royale x @readyplayerme - Interoperability achieved \uf8ff\u00fc\u00f6\u00c4 Use your Mini Royale heroes in hundreds of Ready Player Me enabled apps like @Spatial_io and @_portals_\uf8ff\u00fc\u00ee\u00c5Use your Ready Player Me avatars in Mini Royale pic.twitter.com/Ka1P2Pheqw\u2014 Mini Royale: Nations (@MiniNations)\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nReady Player Me also helps new users discover Mini Royale: Nations, either through people wearing their hero avatars in other apps and games or through the Ready Player Me Hub. The improved discovery is leading to the potential of attracting new users and growing monthly active users.\n\nIntegrate Ready Player Me avatars into your app\n\nAre you looking to attract and retain users for your live app?

        "page_content": "Opinions\n\nWhere's The Metaverse Heading in 2023\n\n14\n\nFebruary\n\n2023\n\nmin read\n\nMetaverse is no longer just fiction from books and movies. In many ways, it\u2019s already here, and everyone seems to be talking about it. And it\u2019s not just tech blogs and startup founders \u2013 there are countless articles, interviews, books, and TV shows talking about the metaverse.\n\nEven though the idea of immersive virtual worlds it\u2019s getting more real, there\u2019s still a long road ahead until it reaches wider adoption. We asked Ready Player Me partners about their thoughts on the current state of the metaverse and where it\u2019s heading in 2023.\n\nWhere's the metaverse today?\n\n2022 wasn\u2019t an easy year for many companies building the metaverse. Both crypto and stock markets were hit by an economic crisis, making it harder for smaller companies to get their projects off the ground. Some bigger players and brands reevaluated their metaverse strategies altogether. \u201c[A lot of companies and] potential clients lost their interest in the metaverse,\u201d said Ethan Cohen, CEO of PolyLand. \u201cThey backed out of it due to the conditions compared to a year ago.\u201d\n\nEven the term metaverse didn\u2019t have it easy. Sean Kauppinen, Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer at Hiber, said that \u201ctoo many people coming in muddied the term. They tried doing a quick hype grab, often without having sustainable business models or even long-term goals. They only had ideas.\u201d\n\nAnother problem highlighted by Ready Player Me partners is the lack of valuable use cases for the metaverse. \u201c\u200bUsers want to access virtual spaces for a specific reason,\u201d said Andrew Sands, Co-Founder of PixelMax. \u201cSome of our users are city planners and architects engaging avatar-to-avatar digitally instead of looking at a 2D drawing shared by one person or traveling all the way to the physical location.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges of 2022, it was still a thriving and vital year for many companies building the metaverse. \u201cThis year was a building phase for companies that held on. Those companies will stay the longest and improve the most,\u201d said Ethan. In 2022, Ready Player Me\u2019s partner network grew 5x, from 1,015 to 5,135.\n\nThe biggest technical challenges of the metaverse\n\nSome of the biggest problems that the metaverse is currently facing are technical, like restricted resources of consumer hardware. It limits how immersive and visually impressive the metaverse can be today. One of the potential solutions to this problem is Pixel Streaming, used by Yabal, PixelMax and PolyLand.\n\nPixel Streaming makes it possible to play graphics-intensive games through a web browser. It only uses as much computing power as a video call, making it accessible on any platform with the right browser stack. \u201cI think a goal of traditional gaming companies is to have their games available on a web-accessible platform,\u201d said Ethan Cohen. \u201cIt doesn't require downloading huge files and updating, which is the main issue with modern gaming consoles. Having everything ready in seconds will improve the gaming experience.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, in its current form, Pixel Streaming is an expensive solution for businesses. As Eddie Aspden (Chief Architect at PixelMax) said, \u201cthere needs to be infrastructure that can sustain these kinds of experiences, often with bespoke hardware deployed close to users \u2013 as big companies do with CDNs.\u201d In the case of PixelMax, they rely on their own infrastructure built to optimize their platform's performance and running cost.\n\nBut there are experiences where Pixel Streaming makes a lot of sense, like ticketed virtual concerts. \u201cJust to enter Yabal\u2019s virtual world, Pixel Streaming is not the right solution. But to enter shows and performances, the value is high enough that people are willing to pay for it,\u201d said Dominik Faber, Co-Founder & CEO of Yabal.\n\nGame developers can also look for ways to optimize their existing stack to fit a wider range of devices and network connections. With the Avatar API that we launched last year, we saw up to a 5x reduction in avatar file sizes with a 50% reduction in the poly count. Changes like this can have a major impact on a game\u2019s performance, especially in multiplayer experiences.\n\nThe role of interoperability in the metaverse\n\nAs companies and brands are willing to work together on building the metaverse, interoperability is an often discussed topic. \u201cRather than having a lot of separate experiences, [the metaverse is] about connecting them together,\u201d said Sean.\n\nTo set foundations for interoperability, companies need to come together to set standards. \u201cWe are already there with certain things like game engines. There are only a few solutions that almost everyone uses, like Unity and Unreal,\u201d said Eddie. \u201cFile formats like glTF have come to their own. They make it possible to carry any 3D assets to any virtual environment. Formats like that are driving us towards making everything interoperable.\u201d\n\nNot following standards set by the rest of the industry makes interoperability hard to achieve. \u201cWe are trying to bring NFT projects to our platform, but it's very challenging since everyone is following different standards or doing things their own ways,\u201d said Dominik. \u201cThe idea of using NFT profile pictures the same way as Ready Player Me avatars will never become a reality. There are optimized for the visual appearance, not for interoperability. It's hard to build a character system optimized for many platforms and engines.\u201c\n\nReady Player Me is interoperable by design, allowing users to create avatars and import them to supported experiences. In 2022 alone, our users created over 3 million avatars and used them in 3,000+ apps and games.\n\nWhere\u2019s the metaverse heading in 2023?\n\nThere are many predictions for the metaverse's future. Ethan and Sean agreed that brands will be one of the biggest players in the metaverse next year, \u00a0driving user adoption on a much bigger scale. \u201cThe adoption within general consumers will be driven by great immersive experiences, like being able to visit virtual stores and try things on avatars or doing training in an immersive world,\u201d Andy added. In 2022 alone, Ready Player Me worked with brands like Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al to bring their outfits to our avatar creator and partner apps.\n\nSean Kauppinen said, \u201cCommerce [in the metaverse] is going to start in real because there will be a utility for it. If you have an avatar [like Ready Player Me] that works in multiple apps like Hiber, Somnium Space and Spatial and allows you to wear digital outfits \u2013 that's awesome. You have three different companies that don't have a business relationship, utilizing the same technology and tool to provide an experience to users who can do whatever they want. The more of that you can get, the more value there is to the consumer,\u201d said Sean Kauppinen.\n\nAdd Ready Player Me avatars to your app or game\n\nWe are on a mission to break down the virtual walls to build a more open and connected metaverse. Our cross-game avatar platform is used by 6,000+ developers, including VRChat, Portals, Spatial, and Hiber.\n\nReady Player Me is free to use for users and developers.

        "page_content": "For Developers\n\nHow to get started with the Avatar API in Unity\n\n30\n\nNovember\n\n2022\n\nmin read\n\nLast month, we released the Avatar API \u2013 our avatar interoperability layer that improves avatar performance and integration flexibility. We have already seen Ready Player Me partners use it to make their games run smoother or to generate 2D user profile pictures.\n\nThe Avatar API makes changing Avatar Config simple, regardless if you're building a web experience or a game in Unity. We partnered with Dinesh Punni from Immersie Insiders to go over the API's features and using it with Unity.\n\nHow to use the Avatar API\n\nAll you need to get started with the Avatar API with an avatar ID that ends with the GLB file extension. You can get an avatar URL to your existing avatar from the My Avatars section of the Ready Player Me Hub or by creating it on the demo subdomain. It should look like this: https://api.readyplayer.me/v1/avatars/6185a4acfb622cf1cdc49348.glb\n\nAvatar API allows you to change the Avatar Config by adding parameters to the URL. For example, to change the mesh's level of detail, you have to add ?meshLod=2 at the end of the link: https://api.readyplayer.me/v1/avatars/6185a4acfb622cf1cdc49348.glb?meshLod=2.\n\nCurrently, you can use the following parameters, with more to come in future releases:\n\nmeshLod \u2013 control the triangle count of the returned avatar\n\ntextureSizeLimit \u2013 set the upper limit for texture resolution in pixels of any texture in the avatar\n\ntextureAtlas \u2013 generate a texture atlas of the desired resolution\n\nmorphTargets \u2013 comma-separated list of individual morph targets or morph target standard groups to include on the avatar\n\npose \u2013 define the pose for a full-body avatar\n\nuseDracoMeshComparassion \u2013 reduce the file size by compressing output avatars with Draco mesh compression\n\nuseHands \u2013 toggle hands for half-body VR avatars\n\nYou can see a list of all available values in our developer docs.\n\nGetting 2D renders through the Avatar API\n\nBy changing the file extension from GLB to PNG, you can export a 2D render of the avatar using the Render API. There are a couple of parameters that let you change the render background and avatar's expression:\n\nscene \u2013 the name of the portrait type to render (full-body, half-body, transparent, etc.)\n\nblendShapes \u2013 map of 3D meshes to their blend shapes (changing avatar's expression)\n\nSee the list of all available values for 2D avatars.\n\nAccess metadata of an avatar\n\nAvatar API also allows you to see the following metadata of an avatar:\n\nbodyType (full-body or half-body)\n\noutfitGender (masculine or feminine)\n\noutfitVersion (depends on the outfit)\n\nskinTone (provided as a hex value \u2013 you can use it for setting the skin tone of custom hands for VR avatars)\n\ncreatedAt\n\nupdatedAt\n\nUsing the Avatar API with the Unity SDK\n\nIf you're using the Ready Player Me Unity SDK, you can access Avatar API's features directly through the Unity editor. You can also take advantage of the Scriptable Objects and dynamically change the Avatar Config based on the gameplay. It can be used for things like distance-based rendering of avatars with a variable mesh LOD. You can use one of the default Avatar Configs or create a custom one that fits your needs.\n\nGet started with the Avatar API and Ready Player Me\n\nYou have everything that's needed to get started with the Avatar API. Head to the developer docs for more detailed instructions and to learn more about integrating Ready Player Me avatars into your app or game. You can also read more about Avatar API from the Immersive Insiders team.\n\nWe spent seven years building a perfect 3D avatar system, so you don't have to. Ready Player Me avatars work on the web, mobile, and every platform that support Unity or Unreal Engine.\n\nJoin the growing list of over 5,000 Ready Player Me partners who integrate our avatars into their apps and games, including Animaze, Immersed, Spatial, and Hiber.\n\nReady Player Me is free to use for users and developers.

Our Unity SDK now allows you to directly access the Render API, cache avatars during runtime and debug with the new SDKLogger tool. The updated developer docs make it easier to try out Ready Player Me and learn more about our partnership program.\n\nToday, we release an updated Unreal SDK and new Unity examples for VR and desktop apps.\n\nPS. In case you missed it, we raised a $56M Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Learn what it means for Ready Player Me.\n\nUnreal SDK v0.17.0: Render API, Avatar caching\n\nThe latest version of our Unreal SDK comes with many new features, loads of improvements and several fixes.\n\nThe Unreal SDK now offers avatar caching as an experimental opt-in feature. After the initial download, they will load much faster.\n\nLike with our Unity SDK, we added direct integration with our Render API to the Unreal SDK. It allows you to get 2D renders of avatars and use them for things like leaderboards, user profiles, and more.\n\nStarting with this SDK version, the main development efforts and our developer docs are focused on Unreal Engine 5. However, if you still rely on Unreal Engine 4, you can find useful information in the documentation.\n\nLastly, we would like to ask you for help. We embedded product analytics in our Unreal SDK (and Unity SDK earlier this month) to learn which features need more attention and where we can improve the most. They are disabled by default, but it would help develop our platform if you decide to turn them on. We are transparent about how to use the data \u2013 you can read more about it here. TL;DR: no personal data is captured, and we don\u2019t share any data with third parties.\n\nIntegrate Ready Player Me in Unity PC and VR apps\n\nCurrently, the best way to integrate Ready Player Me in Unity PC and VR apps is with the help of Vuplex. We created a new Unity Vuplex example project to guide you through the implementation.\n\nBecome a Partner and add Ready Player Me avatars to your app or game\n\nExcited about new features coming to our platform?

We have been working hard on bringing new features to our avatar platform and SDKs. But before we dive into the new features, we have to celebrate: Ready Player Me is now used by 3,000+ developers! We are grateful to have amazing partners like you join us in building an open and interoperable metaverse.\n\nNow onto what's new in Ready Player Me for developers.\n\nUpdated Unity SDK with avatar renders and runtime caching\n\nThe latest version of our Unity SDK (v1.11.0) is now available. You can now take advantage of our Render API directly within the Unity SDK, enabling you to create 2D renders of avatars. It's for creating leaderboards or user profiles in the UI of your game.\n\nAnother much-requested feature coming in v1.11.0 caching avatars during runtime. Previously it was available only in the Unity Editor, but now you can use it in your app or game, saving users' loading time. Cached avatars are stored in Unity\u2019s `Application.PersistentDataPath`. If you're looking to make loading multiple avatars more efficient, we also added some new examples to our docs.\n\nThe latest version of the Unity SDK also brings SDKLogger \u2013 a debugging tool printing logs about avatar loading operation and status. The results can be viewed during runtime. There are a few smaller improvements too:\n\nOption to remove session info after creating an avatar (great for kiosk-like experiences)\n\nSimplified UI of the Avatar Loader\n\nThe WebView Partner Editor is now renamed to \"Settings\"\n\nLoaded avatars from the Avatar Loader are now imported as Prefabs\n\nLastly, we would like to ask you for help. We embedded product analytics in our SDK to learn which features need more attention and where we can improve the most. They are disabled by default, but it would help develop our platform if you decide to turn them on. We are transparent about how to use the data \u2013 you can read more about it here. TL;DR: no personal data is captured, and we don\u2019t share any data with third parties.\n\nImproved documentation for new partners\n\nOur developer documentation received an upgrade!

If you're not exactly sure what it is \u2013 no worries, you're not alone. Even people working on the metaverse continue to disagree about the definition of the term.\n\nIn this article, we will cover what the metaverse is and a few different ways how you can enter it today.\n\nWhat exactly is the metaverse?\n\nFirst, let's bring some clarity to what the metaverse actually is.\n\nThe term \"metaverse\" comes from the 1992 science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson, \"Snow Crash.\" A similar concept was also covered in the popular \"Ready Player One\" book by Ernest Cline, adapted as a movie by Steven Spielberg. Both novels describe dystopian visions of the future where people seek to escape reality through virtual worlds.\n\nThere isn't a single definition of what the metaverse is or what it will be beyond fiction. The general understanding is that it's a network of virtual worlds where people are represented as avatars. Many of the characteristics of the metaverse can be observed in existing games. That includes platforms such as VRChat, Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft.\n\nAt the moment, the metaverse is shaping to be more than a single virtual world. There will be hundreds of thousands of them, all connected through different platforms like Ready Player Me.\n\nWhat device do I need to access the metaverse?\n\nMinh Pham on\n\nUnsplash\n\nYou don't need an expensive gaming rig or virtual reality headset to enter the metaverse. Many virtual worlds offer cross-platform compatibility with VR/AR hardware, desktops, and mobile devices. As long as you have a relatively new computer, phone, or tablet that supports the latest version of the operating system and web standards, you can access thousands of immersive experiences.\n\nIf you want to give virtual reality a shot, you have a few options. The most popular standalone VR platform is the Meta Quest 2, which supports thousands of experiences \u2013 from AAA games to small indie productions. All you need to get started is the VR headset itself \u2013 it doesn't require any additional hardware or cables.\n\nIt's still early for augmented or mixed reality devices. We are probably a few years away from an affordable and sleek pair of everyday AR glasses. There are a few existing mixed reality headsets like the Microsoft HoloLens 2 or MagicLeap, but these are only available to enterprise customers. What's in everyone's reach already are augmented reality apps on iOS, Android, and even mobile web browsers. If you played games like Pok\u00e9mon GO, you have already experienced AR.\n\nMetaverse platforms you can enter today\n\nThere are many metaverse platforms that you can enter today, some with millions of active players. There are a few things that you can do on most of these platforms:\n\nExplore them with your virtual avatar, like Ready Player Me;\n\nHang out with other players or your friends;\n\nOwn and build on top of a virtual land or own your personal space;\n\nDisplay your collectibles and NFTs;\n\nAttend virtual events and concerts.\n\nLet's go over a few metaverse platforms that you can try out today.\n\nSpatial\n\nSpatial is the metaverse for culture. The platform lets you join thousands of users hosting virtual galleries and events in beautiful artist-built spaces. Spatial offers full cross-platform compatibility with Web, iOS and Android (including an AR mode) and Oculus VR.\n\nHere's how to enter the Spatial metaverse:\n\nVisit spatial.io and create an account;\n\nPick one of the galleries, like the Spatial Park;\n\nClick on the avatar icon in the bottom right corner to create or import your Ready Player Me avatar.\n\nSomnium Space\n\nSomnium Space is an open, social and persistent virtual reality platform powered by Solana and Ethereum blockchains. It lets you build on top of virtual parcels, import your NFTs, and explore virtual worlds owned by others. The platform even has its own token called $CUBE. Somnium Space works on the web and PCVR platforms.\n\nHow to enter the Somnium Space metaverse:\n\nVisit the Somnium Space website and click \"Join SOMNIUM\". You will be redirected to one of the hundreds of parcels;\n\nSign in or create a Somnium Space account;\n\nClick on the cog icon in the top right corner and click \"Change Avatar\";\n\nSelect \"Custom\" to create or import your Ready Player Me avatar.\n\nPortals\n\nPortals lets you own a place in the metaverse. All holders of their Citizen Cards NFTs get their personal Pods where they can invite over other users of the platform and display their Solana and Ethereum NFTs. There's also the Portals Downtown area with virtual real estate from brands like Binance.US, Magic Eden, and others.\n\nHere's how to enter the Portals metaverse:\n\nGo to theportal.to and click \"Owner Login\". If you don't have an access card, you can try the demo here;\n\nSign in with your Solana wallet if needed;\n\nClick the \"Ready Player Me\" button to create or import your avatar.\n\nMona\n\nMona is a metaverse platform with beautiful virtual spaces created by artists where you can collect and show art and gather with other users. You can buy a space in Mona on OpenSea or create your own from scratch. Mona organizes build-a-thons where you can win rewards for creating new spaces.\n\nHow to enter the Mona metaverse:\n\nGo to mona.gallery;\n\nSelect one of the virtual worlds from the list, like the Ready Player Me Sky Lounge;\n\nClick \"Avatar\" or press 4 on your keyboard to create or import your Ready Player Me avatar.\n\nThe Nemesis\n\nThe Nemesis is a metaverse with virtual worlds, art galleries, stores, \u00a0games, etc. The platform also hosts virtual events from different brands, like the Non-Fungible Conference earlier this year.\n\nHow to enter The Nemesis metaverse:\n\nGo to thenemesis.io and click \"Play\". You can also download the app on your Android or iOS device;\n\nSign up or log in to get access to all of the features;\n\nPress the Escape key and select \"Avatar\" from the drop-down menu;\n\nSelect \"Ready Player Me\" and click \"Modify\" to edit your avatar.\n\nCreate your 3D avatar for the metaverse\n\nRegardless of which metaverse you're going to enter, you will need a 3D avatar to represent yourself. All of the abovementioned experiences and apps and games from over 2,000 developers support Ready Player Me. It's the default avatar platform for the metaverse.\n\nReady Player Me lets you create a 3D avatar for the metaverse using a selfie. Take a picture, and our machine learning algorithm will generate an avatar that looks just like you. You can also choose one of the pre-made avatars and tune it to your liking.\n\nYou can pick from hundreds of avatar customization options, including outfits from brands like New Balance, RTFKT, Pull&Bear, and others. We also partnered with adidas Originals to bring their Ozworld avatars to Ready Player Me and compatible apps and games.\n\nCustomize your avatar with NFTs\n\nBesides hundreds of free customization options, Ready Player Me avatars are also compatible with selected NFT projects. Last year, we added support to the Head5 collection, featuring 5,555 unique headwear options based on deadmau5's legendary helmets. We also created the Ready Player Me Punks collection exclusive to the CryptoPunks holders.\n\nMore NFT projects are coming soon to Ready Player Me, including drops created by our team and collections from artists like PIXELORD. Follow us on Twitter if you don't want to miss them.\n\nBuild your own metaverse\n\nIf you want to create your own metaverse or build a branded metaverse experience, now it's the best time. With tools like Ready Player Me, building your own platform couldn't be easier. You can integrate our cross-app avatar system for free. To get started, sign up to become a partner.",

        "page_content": "Opinions\n\n3 Things To Include In Your Brand's Metaverse Strategy\n\nMay\n\n2022\n\nmin read\n\nThe term \"metaverse\" is being thrown left and right by the media. For an outsider, it may seem that it's just a buzzword used to get the reader's attention. But the truth is, in many ways, the metaverse is being built right in front of our eyes. And every day brings more players who want to take part in it.\n\nIf you're managing a brand, now is the best time to embrace and add metaverse to your strategy. Here are a few ways how you can do it.\n\n1. Combine physical and digital experiences\n\nIf your brand already has a strong physical presence, adding a digital component on top of it is a great way to get started with the metaverse. You may even turn it around to appeal to the digital-first community while provoking the interest of your existing fans. There are many ways how you can approach it.\n\nCreate a virtual retail experience\n\nMany retail stores had to shut doors of their physical locations during the pandemic. But at the same time, it was an opportunity for them to focus on expanding their digital presence.\n\nDuring the 2021 London Marathon, New Balance partnered with SportsShoes.com to create a New Balance London SQ virtual store. Users could explore it on the web, purchase apparel, and even try it on Ready Player Me avatars. It was a time-limited activation, but the New Balance outfits remained accessible to the users of the Ready Player Me platform and are compatible with hundreds of apps and games.\n\nBuild an AR (augmented reality) experience\n\nEvery year, we are getting a step closer to an everyday pair of augmented reality glasses that don't look like a sci-fi computer or an on-face camera. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. What's already here, though, are augmented reality mobile applications that now support real-life object occlusion and multiplayer experiences.\n\nWarner Bros. partnered with Yahoo for the premier of the Dune movie to create an augmented reality experience powered by 8th Wall's WebAR technology (now part of Niantic) and built by Aircards. The experience allowed fans of the movie to create a 3D avatar wearing outfits from the movie and place it anywhere in the real world using just a web browser on their phones.\n\nBring your physical products to digital\n\nPerhaps the most interesting approach to embracing the metaverse in a brand's strategy is taking the existing physical products and making them available in virtual experiences.\n\nCharli Cohen, a British fashion designer who blurs lines between physical and digital fashion, has been a pioneer in this area. Her Kaleidorip collection was sold in London's Selfridges and in an immersive \"brandiverse\" experience called Electric/City, co-created with Yahoo. Consumers could purchase both physical and digital versions of the garments. The latter were also compatible with Ready Player Me avatars and supported apps and games.\n\nMore recently, an Inditex-owned Pull&Bear brand created a collection that\u2019s available both in physical form as well as free avatar customization options on the Ready Player Me platform. The collection was featured in Pull&Bear stores around the world and in the brand\u2019s immersive experience. Soon, the company will launch a virtual reality game for the Meta Quest 2 platform.\n\n2. Create digital-first products\n\nAfter testing the metaverse waters, you can dive deeper and start thinking digital-first. The metaverse might still be in its early days, but plenty of opportunities await your brand today.\n\nCreate your own wearable NFTs for avatars\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs, took the tech industry by storm last year. Their biggest advantage is giving the ownership of digital assets directly to the users who no longer have to rely on centralized platforms. For many, NFTs are still an area for discussion due to their high transaction fees (called gas fees) and their impact on the environment.\n\nBut these are becoming past problems as Ethereum is moving to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and other, more sustainable blockchains like Solana and Cardano are gaining more traction. This opens doors for more mainstream adoption of NFTs.\n\nAn NFT doesn't have to be a 2D JPEG \u2013 it can be a 3D asset or a digital fashion piece. And platforms like Ready Player Me provide a completely new utility beyond Twitter profile pictures \u2013 they become wearable assets for 3D avatars. Holders of compatible NFTs can finally take their belongings to the virtual worlds they like. This wasn\u2019t possible in locked-down experiences of the Web 2.0 era.\n\nThe EDM musician deadmau5 took his iconic helmet and partnered with the artist Nick \u201cSmearballs\u201d DenBoer to create the Head5 collection featuring 5,555 unique wearable NFTs. They are fully compatible with Ready Player Me avatars and soon will work with The Sandbox platform. The NFTs also offer utility in-real-life (IRL) \u2013 guest-list access for deadmau5' shows.\n\nCreate your own avatar collection\n\nCreating avatar customization options might not be enough to bring your brand's identity forward. In this case, you should explore creating your avatar collection from scratch.\n\nAdidas Originals have created the Ozworld avatars inspired by their apparel collection under the same name. Users have to answer questions to describe their personalities to make the avatars. A machine learning algorithm chooses the most fitting traits based on that. The avatars are compatible with the Ready Player Me platform and hundreds of apps and games supporting our avatars.\n\n3. Bring your brand to virtual worlds\n\nWhen you're ready to go all-in, it's time for you to set up your brand's virtual presence in the metaverse.\n\nHost a virtual event or concert\n\nOne of the easiest ways to set your foot through metaverse's doorstep is by utilizing the existing platforms and hosting a virtual event. It can be a regular gathering for your community, a virtual music festival, or a digital fashion show.\n\nDuring the last edition of the Non-Fungible Conference in Lisbon, The Nemesis hosted a virtual version of the event, featuring an NFT art gallery, a virtual stage, and challenges for the attendees. The platform allowed anyone to access the event through The Nemesis mobile and web apps.\n\nOwn your branded virtual space or land\n\nMany metaverse platforms are based on an idea of virtual land \u2013 a finite number of virtual worlds where users or companies can build their own experience and host other users. For brands, it's a perfect opportunity to create a gamified experience or set up a virtual store with digital products.\n\nMany platforms are building on top of the idea of virtual lands\u2014each with a slightly different take and technical foundation. Somnium Space, for example, is based on both Ethereum and Solana blockchain and lets its users buy and build on virtual parcels. Pavia and Portals are building similar platforms but based on the Cardano and Solana blockchains respectively.\n\nThe Sandbox is one of the most successful platforms in this area. They already hosted branded experiences and content from RTFKT (owned by Nike), Snoop Dog, deadmau5, Atari, and others.\n\nBuild your own metaverse\n\nIf you want full control over your brand's virtual experience, you can build your own platform from scratch. It's much more resource-intense than collaborating with an existing platform, but not impossible. You can rely on existing gaming engines like Unity or Unreal, create your own digital assets, and bring avatars like Ready Player Me.\n\nIf hiring a team of game developers isn\u2019t an option for you, you can utilize open-source platforms like Mozilla Hubs or tools provided by companies like 8th Wall and Anything World. They give you a great foundation to build your own virtual world without having to dedicate a lot of resources.\n\nA Volkswagen-owned sports car brand, CUPRA, is doing just that. They are building a virtual world called METAHYPE in collaboration with the digital agency VISYON. It will be a virtual island hosting experiences from CUPRA as well as other brands, including Barcelona's biggest music festival, Primavera Sound. Users will be able to explore the island using Ready Player Me avatars wearing custom outfits created by CUPRA and other brands.\n\nDon't wait to get started with the metaverse\n\nThe metaverse is already here. There are many opportunities for you and your brand to engage with it today. Regardless of the option that fits you the most at the moment, the Ready Player Me platform gives you a great foundation to utilize metaverse in your brand strategy. You can bring your digital assets, create an immersive experience with one of our partners, or create a whole new virtual world.\n\nDo you want to work with Ready Player Me on your next branded metaverse experience?

Here's an overview of what they have been up to in the virtual worlds.\n\nWhat exactly is the metaverse?\n\nIf you're still unsure what the metaverse is, here's a short overview.\n\nThe term \"metaverse\" comes from the 1992 science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson, \"Snow Crash.\" A similar concept was also covered in the popular \"Ready Player One\" book by Ernest Cline, adapted as a movie by Steven Spielberg.

There will be hundreds of thousands of them, all connected through different platforms like Ready Player Me.\n\nImmersive shopping experiences and digital fashion in the metaverse\n\nWhen the Internet was growing in the '90s, one of the first things brands were exploring was e-commerce. The metaverse gives companies new and more immersive ways to present their products to consumers.\n\nCharli Cohen is a British fashion designer, known for her collaborations with brands such as Pok\u00e9mon, Capcom, and Assassin's Creed. She partnered with London\u2019s Selfridges and Yahoo to create physical and digital shopping experiences. Users can explore the immersive world of Electric/City to learn more about the digital Kaleidodrip collection. The outfits are compatible with Ready Player Me avatars and can be used in hundreds of compatible apps and games.\n\nAnother example comes from Dior. Last year, they launched the Miss Dior Immersive Journey experience, exploring the brand's history. Users can create their own Ready Player Me with a selfie and use it to explore Dior\u2019s virtual world.\n\nOne of the latest fashion brands to step into the metaverse is the Inditex-owned Pull&Bear. The brand created a virtual fashion collection compatible with the Ready Player Me avatars. Soon, Pull&Bear's customers will be able to import their 3D avatars to a virtual world experience on the Meta Quest 2.\n\nMetaverse-ready avatar collections\n\nDigital fashion collections are one way into the metaverse. Some brands take a step further and make their own full-body avatars. Ozworld avatars created by adidas Originals are the most recent example of it.\n\nThe process of creating the Ozworld avatars is very unique \u2013 users have to answer a set of questions to describe their personalities. A machine learning algorithm chooses the most fitting traits based on that. The avatars will be compatible with the Ready Player Me platform and hundreds of apps and games supporting our avatars.\n\nWearable NFT collections and merchandise for 3D metaverse avatars\n\nMore and more NFT projects go past the standard 2D JPEG profile pictures and offer interesting utility in the metaverse. The Canadian EDM musician deadmau5 partnered with the artist Nick \u201cSmearballs\u201d DenBoer to bring a collection of 5,555 Head5. They are inspired by the giant heads that Joel Zimmerman wears during his shows.\n\nUnlike other NFT projects, the Head5 assets have a true utility in the metaverse. Right now, holders of the NFTs can use them with Ready Player Me avatars in compatible apps and games. Deadmau5 also announced a partnership with The Sandbox, teasing utility on the platform.\n\nBranded virtual worlds in the metaverse\n\nAs more metaverse platforms open their doors, brands look for opportunities to include them in their metaverse strategies. A Volkswagen-owned sports car brand, CUPRA, is building its own virtual world in collaboration with VISYON \u2013 METAHYPE. It will be a virtual island hosting experiences from different brands, including Barcelona's biggest music festival, Primavera Sound. Users will be able to explore the island using Ready Player Me avatars wearing custom outfits created by CUPRA and other brands.\n\nAugmented reality branded experiences\n\nAugmented reality (also known as AR) experiences are often omitted when discussing the metaverse. That being said, they will become more important and common as companies start to introduce their AR glasses and headsets.\n\nWarner Bros. partnered with Yahoo for the premier of the Dune movie to create an AR experience powered by 8th Wall's WebAR technology (now part of Niantic) and built by Aircards. The experience allows fans of the movie to create a 3D avatar wearing outfits from the movie. They can also bring their avatar to life in augmented reality.\n\nVodafone, the UK's biggest telco, integrated AR into their British & Irish Lions rugby team app. It lets team fans create their own Digital Lion based on a selfie and pose in augmented reality with the team's players.\n\nFuture of brands in the metaverse\n\nWe are still in the early days of the metaverse, and it's impossible to guess what we can expect from brands in the space next. The whole Web3 industry is moving and evolving fast, so it's a good idea to keep an eye out for the latest trends.\n\nThere are already many tools and technologies that let you and your brand embrace the metaverse today.

In our case, we\u2019ll look at the performance of the hairstyle classifier that we use in Ready Player Me.\n\nStyleGAN2 is a generative model architecture demonstrating state-of-the-art image generation. Code of the model and pre-trained weights can be found, for example, in this repo, alongside generated examples across various domains.\n\nFirst, what are we going to do? The idea is pretty simple. Having a hairstyle classifier, we\u2019ll search through StyleGAN2 latent space to find directions in it corresponding to each of our classes.\n\nIt\u2019s not the best way to test your model if you need some good-old metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and others. But, this way, you get to see what kind of pictures actually trigger your model to predict a certain class. So, it\u2019s going to be more visual.\n\nThere are, of course, some limitations. The idea to evaluate your classifier by sampling pictures from a GAN model makes sense only if that model can produce pictures with your classes. That means that using StyleGAN pre-trained on human faces to evaluate a classifier that detects cats in images will not produce any adequate results.\n\nA bit of intro to StyleGAN2\n\nLet\u2019s not go too deep into technical details, but here\u2019s what you need to know. If you look at the StyleGAN2 architecture below, you would see that the noise input Z is first mapped to the style space W, which then is fed to the Generator.\n\nManipulating input to StyleGAN in the W+ space may be used to generate images from a certain domain. For example, it\u2019s done in StyleCLIP:\n\nCNN Classifier + StyleGAN\n\nLet\u2019s take our hairstyle classifier and consider one of its classes. Say, \u201ccurly bob with fringe\u201d. The goal is to check whether the classifier is triggered by the right high-level features presented in images.\n\nWhat we want to do is to make our StyleGAN generate pictures that will maximize the probability of the \u201ccurly bob with fringe\u201d class predicted by our hairstyle model. And hopefully, we\u2019re going to see images similar to the ground truth ones. Here\u2019s a code sketch for that part:\n\nWe\u2019re optimizing two losses here:\n\n1. Classifier loss, which is just a cross-entropy between what the hairstyle classifier predicts and the label of the desired class;\n\n2. Identity loss, to preserve the person\u2019s identity while changing only their hairstyle. Sort of like a regularization. For that, we can use, for example, a pre-trained InsightFace.\n\nResults\n\nAfter running tuning for multiple classes, we can now check how well we managed to capture those style directions. For that, we\u2019ll generate a sequence of images adding the learned direction vector to the latent vector W with some weight:\n\nCombining these sequences of images into GIFs, we got something like this for the \u201ccurly bob with fringe\u201d class:\n\nRemember, we got these results simply by maximizing our classifier\u2019s probabilities for a certain class. This shows quite visually what kind of high-level features trigger the classifier to predict a particular class.\n\nLet\u2019s see the same kind of visualizations for one more class, long straight hair with fringe:\n\nThese are both classes that our hairstyle model seems to have learned correctly. With face features not changing much during the interpolation in the W+ space, we see hairstyles in our examples change exactly how they are supposed to.\n\nBut of course, sometimes models overfit or learn to detect something else but the real target features. To illustrate one of those cases, let\u2019s look at interpolation examples for a class of \u201clong African braids\u201d.\n\nHere, we see that maximizing the hairstyle model\u2019s confidence for this hairstyle class also causes changes in skin color. This may suggest, for example, that the dataset is unbalanced for this particular class. Racial disbalance in the dataset can easily cause such behavior and should be dealt with by collecting more images with a more diverse representation.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou could use this method whenever you\u2019ve got a classifier, and want to understand what exactly is driving its decision-making. This is more about making sure that intended high-level features trigger your classifier, and it\u2019s not overfitting to something else.",

        "page_content": "News & Updates\n\nReady Player Me and NFTs: Why and How?\n\nFebruary\n\n2022\n\nmin read\n\nWe've been receiving a lot of questions about Ready Player Me and NFTs. This post will give you an overview of our thinking and clarity around our plans for the future.\n\nFirst, let me make this very clear: Ready Player Me is for everyone. We will never be a priced-out, exclusive community only accessible to a few. Our goal is to build an avatar platform everyone can use across the metaverse. Creating an RPM avatar will remain free forever. NFT adoption will be a matter of choice \u2013 no partners or end-users will be pushed to adopt. For those that opt-out of the NFT path, we will offer other types of virtual goods and ways to make an awesome and unique avatar.\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nHow we believe NFTs can help the Ready Player Me community.\n\nWe help developers monetize. A significant part of the revenue generated from NFTs will be distributed to the apps and games using Ready Player Me avatars \u2014 based on where the assets are used. Companies using RPM will get paid for allowing NFTs into their worlds. This helps our partners monetize and supports building a more open and connected metaverse. Supporting NFTs is an opt-in for developers; some games and apps will support them, and others that don't. We will also offer tools for developers to sell \"traditional\" in-game assets and skins in their experiences.\n\nWe help creators of NFTs make their virtual assets usable in the metaverse. One of the biggest challenges for anyone creating avatar-related digital assets is making your assets usable in virtual worlds. RPM can give creators access to hundreds of virtual worlds through our interoperable avatars. More creators making a living building for RPM avatars means more diverse and high-quality digital assets for everyone.\n\nIt could be a great way for us to monetize as a company. This ensures we can keep Ready Player Me free for developers forever. We believe avatars are a key piece of the metaverse, and every developer should have access to a great avatar system for free.\n\nWhat are we going to do?\n\nReady Player Me Curated Drops: Our team will build drops internally, sometimes in collaboration with an artist or a brand. The goal with these drops is to build high-quality assets and experiment with new concepts. The RPM Punks drop is an example of that.\n\nReady Player Me Partner Drops: We'll partner up with creators to give their assets real utility in the metaverse. The value of an avatar asset you can't wear in the metaverse is limited. We'll take a revenue share from the economy on our avatars and share 50% of that with the games and apps using RPM in their products. We can deliver NFT assets to non-blockchain games without developers having to do any additional work. This allows us to introduce new developers to the benefits of Web3. An example of a partner drop is Head5 by deadmau5.\n\nReady Player Me Airdrops: Offering free drops to our early community. This helps us reward our early supporters.\n\nAvatars are a canvas for digital assets. The assets themselves can be accessories, clothing items, skins, or complete avatars. We're excited to see what people come up with!\n\nReady Player Me is not a digital fashion brand. We're building infrastructure to give developers an awesome avatar system, end-users a portable avatar, and digital fashion brands a way to make their assets usable in the metaverse. We will work on some drops ourselves, but our primary goal is to support other companies and projects building on our platform.\n\nWe're not planning to build our own NFT marketplace. We're open to integrating any existing marketplaces with RPM.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nWe started Ready Player Me with a few core hypotheses on where the world is going:\n\nPeople will spend an increasing amount of time in virtual worlds in the future, represented as an avatar. This means our avatar representations are critical and will become an even bigger part of our lives over time.\n\nThe metaverse is not a single app. It's a network of thousands of virtual worlds. Creating a new avatar for each world doesn't make sense. A portable virtual avatar that travels across virtual worlds is needed.\n\nThe avatar economy grows as avatars become an increasingly important part of our daily lives. Adding portability to digital assets will make them more valuable than in today's mostly closed game economies. Would you rather pay for a skin that works in 1 or 1000 games? This is a major opportunity for creators to take part and make a living serving the avatar market.\n\nWe initially imagined the creator-driven avatar economy would look similar to the traditional skins and virtual goods marketplaces in games like Roblox. When NFTs blew up last year, we got curious. We started actively taking part in the market ourselves personally to learn and understand how this could help us achieve our mission.\n\nThe promise of NFTs is ownership and interoperability. This aligns well with where we believe the (virtual) world should be going. It makes sense for the population of the metaverse to own parts of the world they inhabit. Be it through NFTs or other ways, we believe this is true.\n\nNFTs are still very new, and without a doubt, there are many problems with how they are implemented today. The speculation, high gas fees, the environmental impact, scams, etc. This is unfortunate, but we believe most of those problems will be solved as the market and technology mature.\n\nWe also believe we can avoid most of those downsides with our own drops. This includes covering the CO2 impact of our drops and using more environmentally friendly blockchains.\n\nConclusion\n\nReady Player Me is for everyone. No partners and end-users will be pushed to adopt NFTs. It's an optional part of the Ready Player Me platform for those interested in taking part.\n\nWe believe digital ownership of assets is a vital part of building a more open and connected metaverse. There are many ways this can help us build a better community and a better product for everyone involved.\n\nWe're incredibly excited to be on this path of learning and building with all of you. It's been a wild ride and it's about to become even more so. Please join us, let's build together.\n\nHere's a list of NFT's we currently support.",
